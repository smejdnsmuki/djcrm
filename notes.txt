-Search for Django packages in Google and type 'forms' to find some styling for forms.

-For environment variables use Django Environ - we can modify the standard variables (lie DEBUG, SECRETE_KEY,...)
instead of going into settings.py (the .env map is connected with settings.py). We also make a copy of .env file
as .template.env so that when we upload to github repository, the variables are seen without
values as the .env will not be shown in repository.

-Before every 'py manage.py runserver' we run :
$env:READ_DOT_ENV_FILE="True"
$env:SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
$env:DEBUG="True"

-Creating Database:
1. createdb -U postgres djcrm (make sure pgAdmin is opened)
2. change database in settings.py
3. make variables in .env
4. psql -U postgres
5. CREATE USER djcrmuser WITH PASSWORD '_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _';
6. \q (quit)

-We use Whitenoise for hosting static files.
